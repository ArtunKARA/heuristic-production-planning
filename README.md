# heuristic-production-planning
A modular heuristic production planning framework. Models the problem as ProblemData (facts) + ScenarioConfig (constraints/weights) + State (solution), then searches for the best plan using plug-in optimizers (Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, hybrid). Focus: lot sizing, capacity &amp; shift-aware scheduling.
